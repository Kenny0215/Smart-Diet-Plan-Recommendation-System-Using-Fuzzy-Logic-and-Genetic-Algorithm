# Smart-Diet-Plan-Recommendation-System-Using-Fuzzy-Logic-and-Genetic-Algorithm

This project is a Smart Diet Plan Recommendation System designed to provide personalized diet recommendations for athletes based on their health profile and performance requirements. The system combines Fuzzy Logic for handling uncertainty and vagueness in human dietary preferences and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimizing meal planning based on nutritional goals.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Fuzzy Logic (Scikit-Fuzzy)
3. Genetic Algorithm (DEAP / custom implementation)
4. Streamlit â€“ Interactive web interface
5. Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data processing
6. Matplotlib â€“ Visualization

ðŸš€ Features
1. User input form for athleteâ€™s age, bmi and activity level
2. Fuzzy inference system to determine nutritional requirements (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
3. Genetic algorithm to generate optimized diet plans using a food database
4. Diet plan output with meal suggestions, nutrient breakdown, and total calories
5. Dynamic visual feedback on macronutrient distribution
6. Scalable for different sports and health profiles

ðŸ”¬ Genetic Algorithm Optimization
1. Fitness Function: Match nutritional needs (calories, macros) as closely as possible
2. Chromosomes: Represent combinations of food items
3. Selection, Crossover, Mutation for evolution of meal plans
